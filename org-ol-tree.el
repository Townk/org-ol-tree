;;
;; This file is not part of GNU Emacs.
;;
;;; Commentary:
;;
;; For an overview information about the package with a quick start,
;; installation and usages, refer to the README.org file distributed along with
;; this file.
;;
;; This file is splitted into 8 major sections with each one having its own
;; number of subsections. I chose this organization to force me to keep a good
;; separation between the package major components. These sections are also used
;; to separate their unit test files.
;;
;; For namespaces the package uses the `org-ol-tree' prefix and each section
;; adds its own namespace to it.
;;
;; This is the list of all sections with their namespace indicated between
;; parenthesis, and its respective subsections:
;;
;; - Variables
;;   - Private variables
;;   - Configuration variables
;;   - Constants
;; - System information (system)
;; - Core objects (core)
;;   - Sections
;;   - Headings
;;   - Document
;; - UI (ui)
;;   - Icons
;;   - Window
;;   - Buffer
;; - Node actions (actions)
;; - Treemacs extension
;; - Mode definition
;; - Commands
;;
;; Because each variable has its namespaces defined by the section that uses it,
;; the "Variables" section has no namespace defined. The "Treemacs extension"
;; and "Mode definition" don't have namespaces either because those are pure
;; configuration sections. And in the end, the "Commands" section uses the main
;; namespace for itself.
;;
;; Another important convention I use in this file is the "double-dash" for
;; privates. This means that if you see a function or variable with a "--"
;; separating its namespace from its name, this function or variable are meant
;; exclusively for the internals of this package.

;;;; --- Variables

;; After reading about sections in this file and their respective namespaces,
;; you might ask why am I defining the package's variables on the top of the
;; file? There are 2 reasons for it:
;;
;; 1) When you open this file, besides the information on th header, th first
;;    thing I want you to see, are what you can and can't customize on your
;;    personal config file;
;;
;; 2) I still have some C in me and my first reaction when I declare variables
;;    on any programming language I use, is to put them on the top of the scope,
;;    so I used reason #1 to not change an old habit;

  `:sectiion' - The icon displayed on the left side of all section heading on

All icons are strings. The `:root', `:expanded', and `collapsed' icons are
displayed with the `display' property of a two-characters propertized string.
This is done to guarantee the proper alignment of icons when using unicode or
all-the-icons icons.

The `:section' icon is actually a simple one-line string where we replace the
string \"%(section)\" by the section number of the heading. Different then the
other icons, the `:section' icon allows any arbitrary size string.")
